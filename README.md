## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Make sure to remove line 5 from package.json if hosting on cloud, and once the backend API is hosted and is no longer connected through local host then in app.js on line 11 instead of "/" replace it by whatever is the URL of where the API is being hosted.
